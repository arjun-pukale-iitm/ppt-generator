## Workflow

This application transforms raw text or markdown into a fully styled PowerPoint presentation by combining natural language processing and template-driven slide generation.

First, the input text is parsed and converted into a structured slide plan. The text, along with optional user guidance (e.g., “create a sales pitch”), is sent to a Large Language Model (LLM) such as OpenRouter or OpenAI. Before making this request, the app inspects the uploaded PowerPoint (PPTX/POTX) template to extract available layouts, placeholders, and image assets—this forms the “inventory” shared with the LLM. The LLM then returns a JSON structure specifying each slide’s title, key bullet points, optional speaker notes, layout choice, and suggested template images. This ensures that the textual content is logically divided across slides while adhering to the user’s intent and presentation flow.

Next, the app applies the chosen template’s visual design. Using `python-pptx`, each slide in the plan is programmatically generated by selecting the correct layout from the template’s master slides. Text content is inserted into corresponding placeholders, maintaining font styles, sizes, and colors defined in the template. If the plan references images or specific layout hints, those are matched with the template’s available assets and applied accordingly. This guarantees that the resulting presentation inherits the visual consistency, branding elements, and overall aesthetics of the uploaded template rather than producing a generic deck.

By combining semantic content structuring with strict adherence to template design, the app produces professional, on-brand presentations automatically, freeing users from manual slide creation and formatting.
